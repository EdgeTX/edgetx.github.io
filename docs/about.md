## About EdgeTX


**What is EdgeTX?**

EdgeTX is an open-source firmware for remote control transmitters used in hobbyist RC (radio-controlled) flying and other activities. It is highly customizable, allowing users to configure their transmitters and adjust settings to suit their individual preferences and specific needs.

EdgeTX supports a wide range of RC protocols and can be used with a variety of different transmitters, making it a popular choice among the RC community. Its flexible and powerful features make it a versatile tool for advanced users who want to take their RC activities to the next level.

The EdgeTX project was started on May 6, 2021, as a fork of OpenTX (another open-source radio controller firmware) to create a more optimized, touch-enabled user interface. EdgeTX offers many of the same features as OpenTX. However, it also includes some unique features and improvements over OpenTX, such as a touch-friendly user interface, improved support for Lua scripting, easier integration with third-party hardware, a rapid development cycle, and many other enhancements.

Overall, EdgeTX aims to provide a more user-friendly and streamlined experience for hobbyist RC enthusiasts who want a powerful and customizable firmware for their transmitters. 

**Community**

EdgeTX is a community project – ideas from the community, developed by the community, and enjoyed by the community! The devs for EdgeTX are not the only ones with good ideas. The everyday users understand which features we need to make the software better and which features need to be changed. We need your feedback and ideas to make EdgeTX an awesome user experience.

**Donations**

If you would like to support the project financially, we have a donation system set up at Open Collective. So if you want to help out to run the planned future online-build system and help devs purchase hardware (e.g. radio systems & development equipment), you can set-up a regular donation, or send an one-time donation via the following link: [https://opencollective.com/edgetx/donate](https://opencollective.com/edgetx/donate)

The usage of the money will be reported at [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/edgetx) and will be transparent to all to see where the money is flowing.

You can also contribute to EdgeTX in other ways. We need developers as well as everyday users to help with development, testing, issue reporting, documentation, or simply spreading the word. We really appreciate any assistance we get. See the [EdgeTX recruiting page](https://edgetx.org/recruiting) for more information.
