## EdgeTX Partnership Program - DRAFT-

The EdgeTX team believes that a close relationship between R/C radio manufacturers and R/C software developers is important for the success of R/C products and ultimately leads to greater satisfaction by the end users. In order to establish close (but neutral) working relationships with R/C radio manufacturers, EdgeTX has established a partnership program.

**Benefits of the partnership program:**

 - EdgeTX Software support for agreed upon hardware platforms by the EdgeTX Team

 - Bug fixing, new features and enhancements for agreed upon hardware platforms.

 - Dedicated nightly and release builds for all agreed upon hardware platforms via Github downloads and EdgeTX flasher.

 - Detailed and documented regression testing for agreed upon hardware platforms for all official releases of EdgeTX

 - Permission to use the ”EdgeTX”, “EdgeTX Approved” and “Official Partner of EdgeTX” logos on merchandise, advertising and marketing material.

**Requirements for manufactures:**

 - Provide a reasonable number of hardware devices as requested by the EdgeTX team, to be used for initial development and testing.

 - Provide a monthly or annual donation (amount to be agree upon with EdgeTX team) to help defray the cost of the online build systems, events and other administrative expenses (to be used at the sole discretion of the EdgeTX team).

 - Provide technical information regarding desired supported platforms as requested by the EdgeTX team.

**Additional  important information:**

Participating in the partnership program does not give the manufacturer any legal stake, ownership or management rights in the EdgeTX project. Nor does it constitute any type of legal partnership.

Partners may request the development of new features or support for new platforms, however there is no implied “right” to said features. The end decision on EdgeTX development will always be reserved for the EdgeTX team.

EdgeTX team will remain neutral between all partners and will not favor one partner over other partners.

The EdgeTX team will do its best to faithfully fulfill it’s responsibilities in regards to the partnership agreement, however the EdgeTX Team reserves the right to decide to support, delay support or not support a certain feature or hardware platform based on available resources and time.

The EdgeTX team will do its best to provide a high quality, stable software for use in the manufacture's radios. When issues are found, the EdgeTX team will do it's best to resolve these issues as quick as possible. However, no timeline can be guaranteed for fixes. The partnered manufactures are encouraged to keep an open communication channel and express impact of issues that they think are critical so that the EdgeTX team can work to address these issues appropriately. However, EdgeTX assumes no liability for any issues or damages that arise do to the use of its' software.

Partnered manufacturers or the EdgeTX Project Steering Committee may decide to end the manufactures participation in the partnership program at any time, without cause. 

If you are interested in participating in the Partnership program, please contact a member of the EdgeTX Project Steering Committee for more information.
