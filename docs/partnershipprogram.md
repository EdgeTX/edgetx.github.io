## EdgeTX Partnership Program

The EdgeTX team believes that a close relationship between R/C radio manufacturers and R/C software developers is important for the success of R/C products and ultimately leads to greater satisfaction by the end-users. In order to establish close (but neutral) working relationships with R/C radio manufacturers, EdgeTX has established a partnership program. 

By participating in this program, the R/C radio manufacturers are helping support the volunteer developers that are donating their time to create EdgeTX. The monetary and hardware donations that are provided will help ensure that the core developers are equipped with the needed equipment needed to support their radios as well as help sustain the online build system that will provide the end-users, the ability to get the most up to date software for their radios at any time. 

**Benefits of the partnership program:**

 - EdgeTX Software support for agreed-upon hardware platforms by the EdgeTX team.
 
 - Consulting regarding transmitter hardware and software design.

 - Priority bug fixing, new features, and enhancements for agreed-upon hardware platforms.

 - Dedicated nightly and release builds for all agreed-upon hardware platforms via GitHub downloads and EdgeTX Flasher.

 - Detailed and documented regression testing for agreed-upon hardware platforms for all official releases of EdgeTX.

 - Permission to use the ”EdgeTX”, “EdgeTX Approved” and “Official Partner of EdgeTX” logos on merchandise, advertising, and marketing material.

**Requirements for manufacturers:**

 - Provide a technical contact person for communication with the EdgeTX Team.
 
 - Provide a sales or marketing contact person for communication with the EdgeTX Team.
 
 - Provide schematics, and other technical information for the EdgeTX-supported hardware to the PSC (not to be shared with others, including other partners).
 
 - Provide a reasonable number of hardware devices, as requested by the EdgeTX team, to be used for initial development and testing.

 - Provide a monthly or annual donation (amount to be agreed upon with the EdgeTX team) to help defray the cost of the online build systems, events, and other administrative expenses (to be used at the sole discretion of the EdgeTX team).

**Additional  important information:**

The partnership program is intended to be a mutually beneficial collaboration between the R/C radio manufacturers and the software developers and should not be confused with a legal partnership.

Participating in the partnership program does not give the R/C radio manufacturer any legal stake, ownership, or management rights in the EdgeTX project. 

Partners may request the development of new features or support for new platforms, however, there is no implied “right” to said features. The end decision on EdgeTX development will always be reserved for the EdgeTX team.

EdgeTX team will remain neutral between all partners and will not favor one partner over other partners.

The EdgeTX team will do its best to faithfully fulfill its responsibilities in regards to the partnership agreement, however, the EdgeTX team reserves the right to decide when to support a certain feature or hardware platform based on available resources and time.

The EdgeTX team will do its best to provide high-quality, stable software for use in the R/C radios. When issues are found, the EdgeTX team will do its best to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. However, no timeline can be guaranteed for fixes. The partnered R/C radio manufacturers are encouraged to keep an open communication channel and express the impact of issues that they think are critical so that the EdgeTX team can work to address these issues appropriately. However, EdgeTX assumes no liability for any issues or damages that arise due to the use of its' software.

Either party may choose to end their collaboration in the partnership program at any time by notifying the other partner. 

If you are interested in participating in the Partnership program, please contact the EdgeTX project steering committee either on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wF9wUKnZ6H) or via email at: psc@edgetx.org for more information.
