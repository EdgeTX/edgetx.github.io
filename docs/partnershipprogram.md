The EdgeTX Project Steering Committee (PSC), hence referred to as the EdgeTX Team, believes that a close relationship between Radio Control (R/C) radio manufacturers and R/C software developers is important for the success of R/C products and ultimately leads to greater satisfaction by the end-users. To establish close and neutral working relationships with R/C radio manufacturers, EdgeTX has established a partnership program. 

By participating in this program, R/C radio manufacturers are helping support the volunteer developers donating their time to create EdgeTX. Their monetary and hardware donations ensure that core developers have the necessary equipment, cover administrative and marketing costs, and sustain the online build system, enabling end-users to access the latest software for their radios.


## Benefits of the partnership program
 - EdgeTX Software support for agreed-upon hardware platforms by the EdgeTX Team.
 
 - Consulting regarding transmitter hardware and software design.

 - Priority bug fixing, new features, and enhancements for agreed-upon hardware platforms.

 - Dedicated nightly and release builds for all agreed-upon hardware platforms via GitHub downloads and EdgeTX Buddy.

 - Detailed and documented regression testing for agreed-upon hardware platforms for all official releases of EdgeTX.

 - Permission to use the ”EdgeTX” logo and their designated partner tier badge on merchandise, advertising, and marketing material.


## Requirements for manufacturers
 - Provide a technical contact person for communication with the EdgeTX Team.
 
 - Provide a sales or marketing contact person for communication with the EdgeTX Team.
 
 - Provide schematics, and other technical information for hardware to be supported by EdgeTX to the EdgeTX Team (not to be shared with others, including other partners).
 
 - Provide a reasonable number of hardware devices, as requested by the EdgeTX Team, to be used for initial development and testing. And after a product has been released, provide the final hardware version, so that the EdgeTX team can support users.

 - Provide a monthly or annual donation (amount to be agreed upon with the EdgeTX Team) to help defray the cost of the online build systems, events, marketing, and other administrative expenses (to be used at the sole discretion of the EdgeTX Team).


## Partnership Tiers

</P>

We have created partnership tiers that acknowledge and reward our partners for providing substantial financial support to our project:

- Silver Partner: For monthly contributions between € 250 and less than €500.

- Gold Partner: For monthly contributions of €500 or more.
  
We value the generous contributions of all our partners, and our partnership tiers are designed to recognize and appreciate their support. While we will endeavour to provide support to all manufacturers in an unbiased manner, higher-tier manufacturers will receive a higher level of support than lower tiers. Our partners can use their designated partner tier badges on merchandise, advertising, and marketing material as they see fit. You can find high-resolution images of the badges [here](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx.github.io/blob/master/downloads/PartnerTierBadges.zip).


## How to join the EdgeTX Partner Program
To join the EdgeTX Partner program, a manufacturer must first reach out to us either on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wF9wUKnZ6H) or via email at psc@edgetx.org, introducing themselves and giving a summary of what product they are seeking support for. 

Once the EdgeTX Project Steering Committee (EdgeTX PSC) has discussed this internally, if we agree to work with a prospective manufacturer, we will set up a private discussion channel on Discord to continue working with the manufacturer on the handset to a subsequent release of EdgeTX. This would mostly entail meeting the [Requirements for manufacturers](#Requirements-for-manufacturers). Any information shared is protected by a [Non-Disclosure Policy](https://edgetx.org/nda/), which both the EdgeTX PSC and several trusted community developers have agreed to.

Upon the successful inclusion of a handset into the EdgeTX codebase, if all of the [Requirements for manufacturers](#Requirements-for-manufacturers) have been met, the manufacturer can request to become an EdgeTX Partner. This would then be voted upon at the next EdgeTX Project Steering Committee meeting, and the outcome of the vote communicated back to the manufacturer.


### Additional important information
The partnership program is intended to be a mutually beneficial collaboration between the R/C radio manufacturers and the software developers and should not be confused with a legal partnership.

Participating in the partnership program does not give the R/C radio manufacturer any legal stake, ownership, or management rights in the EdgeTX project. 

Partners may request the development of new features or support for new platforms, however, there is no implied “right” to said features. The end decision on EdgeTX development will always be reserved for the EdgeTX team.

EdgeTX team will remain neutral between all partners and will not favour one partner over another partner, other than in regards to the level of support and project resources allocated based on their partnership tier level.

The EdgeTX team will do its best to faithfully fulfil its responsibilities in regards to the partnership agreement, however, the EdgeTX team reserves the right to decide when to support a certain feature or hardware platform based on available resources and time.

The EdgeTX team will do its best to provide high-quality, stable software for use with R/C radios. When issues are found, the EdgeTX team will do its best to resolve these as quickly as possible. However, no timeline can be guaranteed for fixes. The partnered R/C radio manufacturers are encouraged to keep an open communication channel and express the impact of issues that they think are critical so that the EdgeTX team can work to address these issues appropriately. However, EdgeTX assumes no liability for any issues or damages that arise due to the use of its software.

Either party may choose to end their collaboration in the partnership program at any time by notifying the other partner. 

If you are interested in participating in the Partnership program, please contact the EdgeTX Project Steering Committee either on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wF9wUKnZ6H) or via email at: psc@edgetx.org for more information.
