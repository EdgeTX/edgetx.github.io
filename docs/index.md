**EdgeTX v2.9.4 is now live!** 

If you had issues with Frsky D-based telemetry sensors suddenly being 10x higher in value in 2.9.3, this is for you. This also affected RF protocols such as OMP which use Frsky D telemetry. DSMX/LemonRX telemetry sensors were also tamed down a bit, with sensors not connected/sending data omitted from discovery. 

For more information about what has changed, take a look at the [release notes](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/releases/tag/v2.9.4).
