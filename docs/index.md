**Update on EdgeTX & Companion support for TBS Tango 2 and Mambo**

Recently there have been many inquiries about when EdgeTX firmware will be available for the TBS Tango 2 and Mambo radios.  

We were initially targeting to have support for those two radios in EdgeTX v2.6 (Christmas Edition). However, with the change to the FreeRTOS operating system in EdgeTX v2.5, additional unplanned efforts are required that may cause us to shift support for those two radios until EdgeTX v2.7 (Spring Edition).  

We understand that there is great interest in EdgeTX and EdgeTX Companion support for those two radios, and you can rest assured that the teams at TBS and EdgeTX are working together to make this happen.
