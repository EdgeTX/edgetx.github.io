## What's new ##

**January 20th 2024**

**EdgeTX v2.9.3 is now live!** 

If you wanted to use SBUS trainer with the module bay, are using a color screen radio and having inputs disappear or the mixer list go slightly bonkers  or just wanted the Linux Companion to let you check for/download updated firmware or other resources, we've got you covered.

***Just one caution:*** If you have previously used the "delay" option for a mixer, and it didn't seem to work, recheck your model, as it should be working properly now. It was completely ignored if the mixer line was disabled for some flight modes or if there was a switch condition.

For more information about what has changed, take a look at the [release notes](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/releases/tag/v2.9.3).

EdgeTX v2.9.2 is now live. If you were annoyed with not being able to turn the haptic on startup/shutdown off, wanted to configure some of the newer FrSky receivers, were having issues with black themes, or noticed that some widgets wouldn't refresh under certain conditions... you'll be interested in this release. Plus several other nip and tuck fixes.

**EdgeTX v2.9.1 released**

EdgeTX v2.9.1 is now live, which fixes a few small niggling issues that may have affected some users including the black screen themes, some telemetry lost/recovered issues with ELRS, and missing mixer lines when copying models from other transmitters. Before you update please remember to backup your settings, and bench test to ensure everything still works properly before taking it out to the field. Thanks to everyone for finding the bugs and testing fixes!

**EdgeTX Fest 2023 - Celebration of our second year!**

We marked the second year of EdgeTX with a spectacular 2nd annual EdgeTX Fest on September 9th and 10th. This year’s celebration was even more special as we joined in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Heideflieger Hövelhof e.V model flying club at their airfield near Hövelhof, Germany.

Attendees had the opportunity to connect with many of the EdgeTX team members and explore a diverse range of EdgeTX supported radios. The visitors were also able to see some modified radios to spawn their own creativity and we displayed stick end controls and tray setups for couple of higher end radios. Additionally, visitors got hands-on experience flying mini quadcopters, providing an exciting introduction to the RC hobby. All of this unfolded amidst a breathtaking model airshow that left everyone in awe.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who joined us at the fest to commemorate the 2nd year of EdgeTX. Your overwhelming presence and engaging interactions made this event truly unforgettable. A big congratulations to all the lucky drawing winners! In total, thanks to our sponsors, we were able to distribute over 20 radio transmitters, close to 100 Express LRS receivers, 4 beautiful scale RC model airplanes and a large number of further accessories and merchandise to our guests.

A special shout-out to our event sponsors, [RadioMaster](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/), [Flysky](https://www.flysky-cn.com/), [Jumper](https://www.jumper-rc.com/), [BetaFPV](https://betafpv.com/), [FMS](https://www.fmshobby.com/), and [RCVideoReviews.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcJwn8V3MTsib2LjAcTnarg), for their generous contributions of prizes and giveaways. We'd also like to express our deep appreciation to the [Heideflieger Hövelhof e.V](https://heideflieger.de/) model flying club for their invaluable collaboration in planning and executing this phenomenal event.
