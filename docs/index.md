**EdgeTX User Manual**

We have just launched our official EdgeTX documentation page on Gitbook! So far we have only published the EdgeTX user manual for color screen radios. However, the user manual for black & white radios and Companion will be added shortly as well. 

You can take a look at the site here:
https://edgetx.gitbook.io/edgetx-user-manual/

We are looking for contributors of new content for the How-to section, people to work on the user manual for black & white radios, and the EdgeTX Companion user manual. We also need people to proofread new content as well as work to keep the manuals up to date with the software changes in EdgeTX.  

If any of this sound interesting to you and you happen to have some spare time and energy, we would love to hear from you! Feel free to contact us on our #documentation channel on our discord server.

**EdgeTX Fest 2022 - Thank you for celebrating the 1st year of EdgeTX with us!**

Visitors at the fest, that was held this year near Potsdam/Germany, were able to try out some of the EdgeTX-supported radios, including the brand new [Flysky EL18](https://www.flysky-cn.com/el18-specifications) that was publicly revealed for the first time at the fest. Users were able to test the revamped user interface with LVGL backend and check out new functions, such as model labels. Novel input concepts were also presented, such as radio orientation control via IMU and control via a 6-dimensional [SpaceMouse](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/pull/1853) knob. Visitors could also participate in several small competitions, such as RC Car bowling and Tiny Whoop balloon popping. Overall, the event was a great success.

Thank you to all that came out to the EdgeTX Fest to celebrate the first year of EdgeTX with us. Your attendance made for a fun and enjoyable event!  Congratulations to all the contest and drawing winners.  In total, 11 radios and 4 accessory sets were awarded to lucky guests!

Special thanks to our event sponsors for providing the prizes and giveaways for the event – [RadioMaster](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/), [Flysky](https://www.flysky-cn.com/), [3Dconnexion](https://3dconnexion.com/), [BetaFPV](https://betafpv.com/), and [Jumper](https://www.jumper-rc.com/) and to the [NLV Modellflug Saarmund e.V.](https://www.nlvms.de/) for their cooperation in the planning and running of the event.

Thanks again to all participants, sponsors, and supporters of the event.  We are excited to see what the next year will bring to EdgeTX and looking forward to celebrating the second year of EdgeTX next year!

**Update on EdgeTX & Companion support for TBS Tango 2 and Mambo**

Recently there have been many inquiries about when EdgeTX firmware will be available for the TBS Tango 2 and Mambo radios.  

We were initially targeting to have support for those two radios in EdgeTX v2.6 (Christmas Edition). However, with the change to the FreeRTOS operating system in EdgeTX v2.5, additional unplanned efforts are required that may cause us to shift support for those two radios until EdgeTX v2.7 (Spring Edition).  

We understand that there is great interest in EdgeTX and EdgeTX Companion support for those two radios, and you can rest assured that the teams at TBS and EdgeTX are working together to make this happen.
