## It's almost time for the EdgeTX Fest 2023!

We are currently searching for a great location in central Europe to host this special event. If you are a member of an RC Model club, we extend a warm invitation to you to host the EdgeTX development team at your club's flying field, as we come together to commemorate the 2nd anniversary of EdgeTX.

During this event, participants can get some hands-on experience with a wide range of EdgeTX supported radios, as well as the opportunity to meet the development team behind EdgeTX. Additionally, participants can showcase their skills in several competition events, with exciting awards and win cool prizes in the prize drawings.

In terms of logistics, we kindly request a minimum area of approximately 20 mÂ² to accommodate our two tents. Additionally, as the community also has many quad flyers, a location that also caters to their needs would be greatly appreciated. Having nearby parking options would also contribute to the convenience of the attendees.

Our target timeframe for this memorable occasion is the first half of September.  To ensure convenience for everyone, we prefer a location within a 500km radius of Erfurt, Germany. Rest assured, all expenses associated with the event will be covered by the EdgeTX Team. We are also open to collaborating with your club's planned event, adding an extra layer of excitement to the festivities.
