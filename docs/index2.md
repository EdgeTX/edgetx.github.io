**What is EdgeTX?**

EdgeTX is the cutting edge of OpenTX. It is the place where innovative ideas and cutting-edge features are developed and field-tested by the enthusiasts of our hobby.

We understand that some people in our hobby value consistency and reliability over the cutting-edge features – that is alright. For them, OpenTX will remain a consistent and stable option for their radio transmitters. Select features from EdgeTX will also be added to OpenTX in the future as decided by the OpenTX development team.

> To see the list of improvments as well as limitations of EdgeTX,

**Who is the EdgeTX team?**

We all are! The devs for EdgeTX are not the only ones with good ideas. The everyday users understand which features we need to make the software better and which features need to be changed. We need your feedback and ideas to make EdgeTX an awesome user experience.

**Community**

EdgeTX is a community project – ideas from the community, developed by the community, and enjoyed by the community! The community will always have a say in what EdgeTX is and what EdgeTX will be in the future. Without community feedback and involvement EdgeTX cannot exist.

**Donations**

Currently, the EdgeTX team is not yet accepting donations. We believe that it is important to maintain transparency for any received donations and expenditures.  Therefore we want to make sure that the proper groundwork is established before we accept any donations. We are in the process of registering our organization so that we can accept donations and will inform everyone when that is complete. 

In the meantime, you can contribute to EdgeTX in other ways. We need developers as well as everyday users to help with development, testing, issue reporting, documentation, or simply spreading the word. We really appreciate any assistance we get. See the [EdgeTX recruiting page](https://edgetx.org/recruiting) for more information.
