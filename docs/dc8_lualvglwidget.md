## **Contest Details**

**Update:**

Congratulations **Wilhelm Meier** for winning this developer contest. For the winning submission, please see [EdgeTX Lua scripts PR #35](https://github.com/EdgeTX/lua-scripts/pull/35). It was a tight race between PR #35 and [PR #36](https://github.com/EdgeTX/lua-scripts/pull/36) by Offer Shmuely, where Wilhelm's PR was having 69 thumb ups and Offer's PR 62 at the time of closing of the competition.

Wilhelm will receive a [RadioMaster MT12 radio with internal 2.4 GHz ExpressLRS RF module](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/mt12-surface-radio-controller?variant=48008718024935) (per his request), generously sponsored by RadioMaster. This state-of-the-art radio will be shipped directly from the RadioMaster factory to Wilhelm.

**Task:**

Create the most popular new Lua widget using LVGL controls for EdgeTX color screen radios.

EdgeTX v2.11 brings with it the ability to use LVGL controls (such as buttons, sliders, toggles, QR codes, number and text edit fields) in Lua scripts and widgets on colour screen radios (see [LVGL for Lua in Lua Reference Guide](https://luadoc.edgetx.org/next-snapshot/lua-api-reference/lvgl-for-lua/overview), [PR #5179](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/pull/5179), [PR #5558](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/pull/5558), [PR #5808](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/pull/5808) and [PR #5926](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/pull/5926)). The task for this contest is simple - create a new Lua widget that effectively uses LVGL controls, thus showcasing the new capabilities this affords. The challenge? The community of users will be the ones who will decide how good the widget is! So what will they be swayed byâ€¦ Looks? Versatility? Colourfulness? Usefulness? Configurability? ðŸ˜„

Submissions will be via a pull request to https://github.com/EdgeTX/lua-scripts which clearly indicates that the PR is a contest entry (and will subsequently be labelled â€˜contestâ€™), and voting will be based on the PR that has the most thumbs ups to the first PR post at the time the contest closes. More than one submission can be entered, but only one entry will win. In case more than one submission share the same highest amount of thumb ups at the time the contest ends, the entry that was submitted earlier, wins.


**Prize:**

The winner can pick a radio model between RadioMaster [TX16s mkII](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/tx16s-mark-ii-radio-controller), [GX12](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/gx12-dual-band-gemini-x-radio-controller), [Boxer](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/boxer-radio-controller-m2), [MT12](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/mt12-surface-radio-controller), [Zorro](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/zorro-radio-controller) or [Pocket](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/pocket-radio-controller-m2) (sponsored by RadioMaster). The radio will be shipped world-wide (see next sentence for limitations!) free of charge directly from the RadioMaster factory to the winner. Due to current geo-political situation, the prize cannot be shipped to Ukraine or Russia. EdgeTX would cover any possible local import fees (the winner of this competition can hand in the possible import fee bill via our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/edgetx/expenses/new)).
