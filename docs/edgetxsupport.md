##How radio manufacturers can get a version of EdgeTX for their new radio hardware.

If you are a radio manufacturer and are interested in using EdgeTX as the firmware for your radio, there are several ways to achieve this. Under the open-source GPL, anyone can use EdgeTX or create a modified version of EdgeTX to use. The only stipulation is that the source code for the ***modified version*** of EdgeTX ***must*** be ***made available*** for everyone to see and use.

**There are several ways to can get a version of EdgeTX that supports your new radio hardware:**

1. **Develop the support of your hardware yourself and get it merged to EdgeTX code base**
   
    1. Make the needed changes to support your hardware yourself, submit a pull request to the EdgeTX team for review. If approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch of EdgeTX, where they will be published and distributed as part of the normal release schedule.  
    2. The new radio will be added to our list of supported radios after the merge.  
    3. Future development of new features and bug fixes will include all the supported radios for consideration.  
    4. Manufacturers are highly encouraged to participate in testing and fixing bugs to ensure our continuous development will not break the firmware on your radios.  
    5. If you do not have the know-how or resources to make the needed changes to support your hardware yourself, then you can contact the EdgeTX Team to get some pointers to proceed. Alternative you can try to outsource the development to a third party who understands the EdgeTX codebase.  

2. **Co-develop the hardware and firmware with the EdgeTX development team**

    If your radio introduces novel features (e.g., a new hardware platform and/or new hardware capabilities) and you can manage to draw the interest from one or more EdgeTX development team members, a co-development of the new radio support might become an option for you. Try to reach out the EdgeTX development members via [Discord](https://discord.gg/wF9wUKnZ6H) or via email at psc@edgetx.org to see if your proposed new hardware gets enough interest by the development team members for them to volunteer to work on it's support. Please consider that a design that brings something new and novel, rather than rehashing an existing supported handset, is more likely to be accepted/gain the interest of a developer.
   
    ___Note:___ _EdgeTX is developed by volunteers, and while innovative hardware often attracts attention, progress depends on contributorsâ€™ availability. Manufacturers concerned about timelines should allocate internal resources to accelerate development._  

4. **Develop and Maintain your own fork of EdgeTX**
   
    Create your own fork of EdgeTX and implement hardware-specific modifications independently. ***In this case, YOUR development team assumes full responsibility for the long-term maintenance and bug fixes.*** Also, please do keep in mind that to adhere to the EdgeTX GPL-2.0 license, you need to ensure that your fork remains publicly available.
  
    ___Note:___ _To avoid user confusion, **always label** your software as a "custom branch of EdgeTX vx.x.x" (**never** just "EdgeTX"). Commercial use of the EdgeTX logo is strictly prohibited._  

We strongly encourage all manufacturers planning to produce EdgeTX-compatible radio transmitters to contact the EdgeTX Project Steering Committee (PSC) early for collaboration. This allows our experts to advise on optimizing your product for EdgeTX compatibility.  

All manufacturers that are using EdgeTX are encouraged to participate in the EdgeTX partnership program.  Under this program, hardware-specific features and bug fixes will be completed on a priority basis by the EdgeTX Team. More information about the benefits and requirements of the partnership program can be seen under: [EdgeTX partnership program.](partnershipprogram.md)
