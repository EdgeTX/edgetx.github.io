## **Special Notes:**

Filming and photographing will occur during EdgeTX Fest 2025. Participants of events and raffles agree to their picture being taken and to be used by EdgeTX and event sponsors on their website and social media.

Must be 18 or older to be eligible to win prizes. Minors need to be accompanied by an adult.

To be able to win at raffles, must be present at the time of the drawings. If your name is called and you are not there, then you will forfeit the prize and another name will be drawn.

Only a single item or a set can be won by a participant per event day. After winning the first item and by drawing the same name again, another name will be drawn.

## **Special thanks to our event sponsors for their donations and helping to make this event possible:**
