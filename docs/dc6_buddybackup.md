## **Contest Details**

**Task:**

Be the first developer to make a mergeable pull-request (PR) against [EdgeTX Buddy repository](https://github.com/EdgeTX/buddy) with a fully functional online model and radio settings backup and restore functionality for EdgeTX Buddy (https://github.com/EdgeTX/buddy).

The user should be able to select their handset (when in USB storage or bootloader mode) and:

* choose whether to back up one or more (or all models) and/or model settings, and be able to then export/save to local storage

* be able to select the local storage folder, and select models to restore. Collisions with existing model filenames should be detected, and in such cases there should be the ability to overwrite, or rename (and ideally, also auto-rename to free model “slots”). 

Not required, but would be greatly welcome would be for ability to: 

* visualise the changes if there is conflict - i.e. perhaps simply a dual pane text visualisation of difference

* save to / restore from .zip (and also .etx) files


**Prize:**

The winner can pick a radio model between RadioMaster [TX16s MK3](https://radiomasterrc.com/products/tx16s-mk3-radio-controller), [TX16s mkII](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/tx16s-mark-ii-radio-controller), [GX12](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/gx12-dual-band-gemini-x-radio-controller), [Boxer](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/boxer-radio-controller-m2), [MT12](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/mt12-surface-radio-controller), [Zorro](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/zorro-radio-controller) or [Pocket](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/pocket-radio-controller-m2) (sponsored by RadioMaster).
