## **Announcement: Winner of the Companion Simulator Physical Serial Port Connectivity Developer Contest!** ##

We are excited to announce the winner of the Companion Simulator Physical Serial Port Connectivity Developer Contest.

After careful evaluation and consideration, we are proud to declare **Nigel Williams** as the winner! The winning submission can be found in [EdgeTX/edgetx#5584](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/pull/5584). As a token of appreciation for his outstanding contribution, Nigel will receive a [Jumper T20 V2 radio with internal 2.4 GHz ExpressLRS Gemini module](https://www.jumper-rc.com/transmitters/t20-3/) (per his request), generously sponsored by Jumper. This state-of-the-art radio will be shipped worldwide free of charge directly from the Jumper factory to Nigel.

We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Nigel Williams for this well-deserved win. Your contributions continue to enrich the EdgeTX community and propel its growth forward.


## **Contest Details**

**Task:**

Be the first developer to make a mergeable pull-request (PR) against EdgeTX main GitHub repository with a fully working physical serial port connectivity for EdgeTX Companion Simulator. The feature must be fully functional for all presently supported simulator OSes (MacOS/Linux/Windows) and permit interaction with physical peripherals via each simulated radio's AUX ports. Only simulators for radios with factory installed AUX ports are required to be supported. The task would not require to communicate within the simulator with physical internal or external RF modules, as the serial communication with them has too tight timing constraints, which typical computer OS, w/o real-time capabilities, would not be able to adhere to.


**Prize:**

The winner can pick a radio model between Jumper [T14](https://www.jumper-b2b.com/2024-new-jumper-t14-hall-sensor-gimbals-242quot-oled-screen-radio-controller-elrs-edgetx-multi-protocol-p0129.html), [T15](https://www.jumper-b2b.com/2024-new-jumper-t14-24ghz-915mhz-868mhz-cnc-hall-sensor-gimbals-242quot-oled-screen-radio-controller-elrs-edgetx-p0135.html), [T20](https://www.jumper-b2b.com/new-jumper-t20s-rdc90-sensor-gimbals-oled-screen-radio-controller-elrs-edgetx-multi-protocol-p0127.html), [T-Pro S](https://www.jumper-b2b.com/jumper-t-pro-internal-24g-1000mw-expresslrs-elrs-module-radio-controller-hall-sensor-gimbals-edgetx-opentx-p0114.html) in the produced color of his/her choice (sponsored by Jumper). The radio will be shipped world-wide free of charge directly from the Jumper factory to the winner and in case import fees will need to be paid, these will also be reimbursed by Jumper.
