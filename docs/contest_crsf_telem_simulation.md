## **Contest Details**

**Task:**

Be the first developer to make a pull-request (PR) against EdgeTX main GitHub repository with a fully working CRSF/ELRS telemetry simulation for EdgeTX Companion Simulator, just like with the telemetry simulation that is currently supported for FrSky. Ideally use radio/model settings to set the module and protocol on simulator start or in added UI fields to select these. The winning submission should also handle the possibility of both internal and external RF modules being active at the same time.


**Prize:**

The winner can pick a radio model between Jumper T14, T15, T20, T-ProS in the produced color of his/her choice (sponsored by Jumper). The radio will be shipped world-wide free of charge directly from the Jumper factory to the winner and in case import fees will need to be paid, these will also be reimbursed by Jumper.


**Rules**

To be eligible to win the radio, an address of a 18+ years old person is required. Entries from anyone, who has previously won any previous EdgeTX developer contest, will be accepted earliest on September 1st, 2024. Members of the <a href="https://edgetx.org/bylaws/#edgetx-development-team">EdgeTX development team</a> cannot participate in the competition.

The contests ends after first successful submission, or on September 30th, 2024, 23:59 GMT.

The EdgeTX PSC reserves the right not to accept submissions that work incorrectly and / or may negatively impact other parts of the EdgeTX system. The decision of the winner by EdgeTX PSC is final and legal recourse is excluded.
