## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will development for OpenTX stop?**

No, there are no plans to stop developing OpenTX. Select features from EdgeTX will also be added to OpenTX in the future as decided by the OpenTX development team.


**How do I install EdgeTX firmware?**

Detailed instructions for flashing the EdgeTX firmware can be found here: 
[https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx.github.io/wiki/EdgeTX-Installation-Guide](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx.github.io/wiki/EdgeTX-Installation-Guide)

**Will the EdgeTX releases be just beta releases for Open TX or will they be tested and stable for everyday use?**

The EdgeTX releases will be tested and considered stable for everyday use. However, as these releases will occur at regular intervals, they may not reach the level of maturity that OpenTX main releases achieve. We will try our very best to make sure that the software you install on your TX is working and stable. However, issues could get missed in testing and make it into the release. We hope that this is a rarity.


**What features / changes are included in EdgeTX that are not included in the latest OpenTX Release?**

To see the list of improvments as well as limitations of EdgeTX, please review the [release notes for the 2.4.0 release.](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/releases/tag/v2.4.0)


**Will I still be able to use OpenTX Companion to manage my models with EdgeTX?**

Yes, in the future you will still be able to manage your models with OpenTX Companion. The new EdgeTX flasher will only be for downloading the firmware and flashing your radio.

 _Please note- OpenTX Companion is currently NOT compatible with EdgeTX - we are working on that. However, you can import and convert your existing models to use with EdgeTX. See the [installation guide](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx.github.io/wiki/EdgeTX-Installation-Guide) for more information._

**What radio-transmitters are supported?**
* X9Lite 
* QX7 (QX7 with Access must be manually compiled and is not available in the Flasher)
* T12 
* TX12
* T8
* Tlite
* XLite
* XLite S
* XLite Pro (use XLite S Target)
* X9DP 
* X9DP2019 
* X10
* T16
* TX16S 
* X12S
* T18

Basically, everything that is supported in OTX 2.3, minus 9X / 9XR-pro.

**Does EdgeTX support the Flysky Nirvana NV14?**

EdgeTX does not yet have an official release for the Flysky Nirvana NV14. However, we are actively working to fully support it. We have an early BETA version for testing available for installation in the Flasher nightly builds. We intend to have it fully supported in our next release.

**Will EdgeTX follow the same versioning format as OpenTX?**

Although EdgeTX is starting with a versioning scheme in line with OpenTX, we have decided to transition to a more standard versioning scheme going forward. In this scheme, the major version will be listed first, followed by the minor version, followed by the bugfix version. 

_For example:_

_v2.4.0 - Current version_

_v2.4.1 - 1st bugfix release of v2.4 (released as needed)_

_v2.4.2 - 2nd bugfix release of v2.4 (released as needed)_

_v2.5.0 - Minor release (planned for September) - new features, enhancements, and bug fixes._

_v2.5.1 - 1st bugfix release of v2.5 (released as needed)_

_v2.6.0 - Minor release (planned for December) - new features, enhancements, and bug fixes._

_v2.6.1 - 1st bugfix release of v2. (released as needed)_

_v3.0.0 - Major release (not planned) - Major changes to UI, features and functions_
