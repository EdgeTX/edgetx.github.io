**Will the EdgeTX releases be just beta releases for Open TX or will they be tested and stable for everyday use?**

The EdgeTX releases will be tested and considered stable for everyday use. However, as these releases will occur at regular intervals, they may not reach the level of maturity that OpenTX main releases achieve. We will try our very best to make sure that the software you install on your TX is working and stable. However, issues could get missed in testing and make it into the release. We hope that this is a rarity.
