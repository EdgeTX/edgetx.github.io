## **Contest Details**

**Task:**

Be the first developer to make a mergeable pull-request (PR) against EdgeTX main GitHub repository with haptic feedback for EdgeTX Companion Simulator.

The haptic feedback is to be in both visual and audible forms.

The visual form is in the event sound is not available or inaudible on the simulator device, and the audible form is to substitute for the physical vibration of a radio hardware.

The haptic feature is to be implemented for all use cases.

Only simulators for radios with factory installed haptic feature are required to be supported.

The feature must be fully functional for all presently supported simulator OSes (MacOS/Linux/Windows).


**Prize:**

The winner can pick a radio model between RadioMaster [TX16s mkII](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/tx16s-mark-ii-radio-controller), [GX12](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/gx12-dual-band-gemini-x-radio-controller), [Boxer](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/boxer-radio-controller-m2), [MT12](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/mt12-surface-radio-controller), [Zorro](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/zorro-radio-controller) or [Pocket](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/pocket-radio-controller-m2) (sponsored by RadioMaster). The radio will be shipped world-wide (see next sentence for limitations!) free of charge directly from the RadioMaster factory to the winner. Due to current geo-political situation, the prize cannot be shipped to Ukraine or Russia. EdgeTX would cover any possible local import fees (the winner of this competition can hand in the possible import fee bill via our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/edgetx/expenses/new)).
