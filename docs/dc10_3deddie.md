## **Contest Details**

**Task:**

Create the best volumetric 3D printable model of EdgeTX mascot *Eddie the Edgehog* together with EdgeTX star logo:

Eddie is an artistic mix between a badger and an hedgehog, originally devised by Martin Hotar. The participants can alter the pose of Eddie, for the resulting 3D model to sit stably on a flat surface, but should keep the apperance of 3D shaped Eddie as close as possible to the original 2D design. The delicate hand and feet, present in the original 2D drawing by Martin Hotar, can be omitted in the 3D volumetric submission. When using AI tools for the creation, the participants need to make sure that they will get all rights for the usage of the model and that none remain by the AI tool used. By submitting the model to the contest, the participants hand over the rights of the resulting model to the EdgeTX team, whereas EdgeTX team should be permitted to reference the author's name, together with the original 2D design author Martin Hotar, when talking about the volumetric Eddie model.

Bonus points will be given to the design that is divided into separately 3D printable parts that can be printed with more affordable 3D printers that support up to 4 filaments only (e.g. BambuLabs A1 series with AMS lite, Anycubic Kobra X, Snapmaker U1 etc.). The submissions are preferred in a 3MF file format and should be handed in at [EdgeTX Discord #dc10_3deddie](https://discord.com/channels/839849772864503828/1465386376408072254) channel.
