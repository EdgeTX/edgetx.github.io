From time to time, the EdgeTX team organizes developer contests to provide an interesting chance for (new) developers to get involved in the rich EdgeTX ecosystem. EdgeTX development encompasses in addition to embedded firmware development for the microcontroller(s) in the radio, also development of accompanying software running on computer (EdgeTX Companion and Simulator, presently provided for Windows, macOS and Linux), online browser-based tools (e.g. EdgeTX Buddy, served via web-browser), sound design (EdgeTX sound-packs), illustrative and graphical design (EdgeTX themes and UI/UX in general), Lua scripts and widgets development, cloud-based firmware compilation, online documentation (EdgeTX manual, EdgeTX Lua Reference Guide, Developer Wiki pages, EdgeTX website) and more. Get involved in helping to make EdgeTX even better by trying out one of the active developer contests listed below. The winners of the contests will not only become listed in the hall-of-fame of EdgeTX development, but also thanks to our sponsors, they will be awarded top-notch R/C related gear (see the specific contest pages for more info about them).
