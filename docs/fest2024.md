The organizing team will do their very best to be able to demonstrate and distribute items as listed, but will not guarantee the list, e.g. due to shipping problems of the items to the event. The demos and prizes will be split as evenly as possible between the two event days.

## **Special Notes:**

To fly at the event, all pilots must be [AMA members](https://www.modelaircraft.org/membership/enroll) (or [AMA affliate members](https://www.modelaircraft.org/content/affiliate-enrollment) for non-US residents) and must abide by all FAA regulations.

Filming and photographing will occur during EdgeTX Fest 2024. Participants of events and raffles agree to their picture being taken and to be used by EdgeTX and event sponsors on their website and social media.

Must be 18 or older to be eligible to win prizes. Minors need to be accompanied by an adult.

Must be present at the time of the drawings. If your name is called and you are not there, then you will forfeit the prize and another name will be drawn.

Only a single item or a set can be won by a participant per event day. After winning the first item and by drawing the same name again, another name will be drawn.


## **Special thanks to our event sponsors for their donations and helping to make this event possible:**
