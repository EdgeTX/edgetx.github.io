***Note**: To better support the manufacturers' release timelines, the manufacturers' can release an EdgeTX-supported radio with a "ready for manufacture" version of EdgeTX that has been developed in collaboration with the EdgeTX team that has not yet been merged into the main codebase. As a result, this firmware will not be available in EdgeTX Buddy or EdgeTX Companion until the next minor EdgeTX release.
