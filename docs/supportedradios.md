[^1]: Hardware modifications are required to support EdgeTX on Flysky NB4+, see [NB4+ hw mods](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/wiki/Flysky-NB4--Hardware-Mod-for-Complete-EdgeTX-Support) for more info.  
[^2]: Some external RF modules might not work correctly due to radio hardware not able to provide enough power to the module.  
[^3]: Hardware modifications are required to support EdgeTX on Flysky PL18/PL18EV, see [PL18/PL18EV hw mods](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/wiki/Flysky-PL18-%26-PL18EV-Hardware-Mod-for-Complete-EdgeTX-Support) for more info.

***Note**: To better support the manufacturers' release timelines, the manufacturers' can release an EdgeTX-supported radio with a "ready for manufacture" version of EdgeTX that has been developed in collaboration with the EdgeTX team that has not yet been merged into the main codebase. As a result, this firmware will not be available in EdgeTX Buddy or EdgeTX Companion until the next minor EdgeTX release.
