We displayed in our booth a variety of EdgeTX driven radios, so all visitors could have hands-on experience with our software and supported hardware. Like every year, thanks to our sponsors, all radios shown were then raffled to visitors who decided to participate.</p> <p>To show EdgeTX capabilities this year we prepared RC controlled 3D printed model forklift and warehouse shelves. It was an outstanding attraction and almost everyone tried to manoeuvre the palettes using EdgeTX operated surface radio.</p> <p>Our Gold Partner Flysky officially launched their newest portable radio PA01 during EdgeTX Fest 2025. </p> <p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who joined us at the 2025 Fest to celebrate the 4th year of EdgeTX. Your overwhelming presence and engaging interactions made this event truly unforgettable. A big congratulations to all the lucky drawing winners!</p> <p>Thanks to our sponsors, we were able to distribute over 20 radio transmitters and a large number of further accessories and merchandise to our guests.</p> <p>A special shout-out to our event sponsors RadioMaster, Flysky, Jumper and BetaFPV for their generous contributions of prizes and giveaways.

This state-of-the-art radio will be shipped directly from the RadioMaster factory to Wilhelm.</p> <p>Task:</p> <p>Create the most popular new Lua widget using LVGL controls for EdgeTX color screen radios.</p> <p>EdgeTX v2.11 brings with it the ability to use LVGL controls (such as buttons, sliders, toggles, QR codes, number and text edit fields) in Lua scripts and widgets on colour screen radios (see LVGL for Lua in Lua Reference Guide, PR #5179, PR #5558, PR #5808 and PR #5926). The task for this contest is simple - create a new Lua widget that effectively uses LVGL controls, thus showcasing the new capabilities this affords. The challenge? The community of users will be the ones who will decide how good the widget is! So what will they be swayed by\u2026 Looks? Versatility? Colourfulness? Usefulness? Configurability? \ud83d\ude04</p> <p>Submissions will be via a pull request to https://github.com/EdgeTX/lua-scripts which clearly indicates that the PR is a contest entry (and will subsequently be labelled \u2018contest\u2019), and voting will be based on the PR that has the most thumbs ups to the first PR post at the time the contest closes. More than one submission can be entered, but only one entry will win. In case more than one submission share the same highest amount of thumb ups at the time the contest ends, the entry that was submitted earlier, wins.</p> <p>Prize:</p> <p>The winner can pick a radio model between RadioMaster TX16s mkII, GX12, Boxer, MT12, Zorro or Pocket (sponsored by RadioMaster). The radio will be shipped world-wide (see next sentence for limitations!) free of charge directly from the RadioMaster factory to the winner. Due to current geo-political situation, the prize cannot be shipped to Ukraine or Russia. EdgeTX would cover any possible local import fees (the winner of this competition can hand in the possible import fee bill via our OpenCollective page).</p> <p>Rules</p> <p>To be eligible to win the radio, an address of a 18+ years old person is required. Entries from anyone, who has previously won an EdgeTX developer contest, will be accepted earliest on April 1st, 2025. Members of the EdgeTX development team cannot participate in the competition.</p> <p>The contests ends on midnight of April 30th, 2025 GMT.</p> <p>The EdgeTX PSC reserves the right not to accept submissions that work incorrectly and / or may negatively impact other parts of the EdgeTX system.

The only stipulation is that the source code for the modified version of EdgeTX must be made available for everyone to see and use.</p> <p>There are several ways to can get a version of EdgeTX that supports your new radio hardware:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Develop the support of your hardware yourself and get it merged to EdgeTX code base</p> <ol> <li>Make the needed changes to support your hardware yourself, submit a pull request to the EdgeTX team for review. If approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch of EdgeTX, where they will be published and distributed as part of the normal release schedule.  </li> <li>The new radio will be added to our list of supported radios after the merge.  </li> <li>Future development of new features and bug fixes will include all the supported radios for consideration.  </li> <li>Manufacturers are highly encouraged to participate in testing and fixing bugs to ensure our continuous development will not break the firmware on your radios.  </li> <li>If you do not have the know-how or resources to make the needed changes to support your hardware yourself, then you can contact the EdgeTX Team to get some pointers to proceed. Alternative you can try to outsource the development to a third party who understands the EdgeTX codebase.  </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Co-develop the hardware and firmware with the EdgeTX development team</p> <p>If your radio introduces novel features (e.g., a new hardware platform and/or new hardware capabilities) and you can manage to draw the interest from one or more EdgeTX development team members, a co-development of the new radio support might become an option for you. Try to reach out the EdgeTX development members via Discord or via email at psc@edgetx.org to see if your proposed new hardware gets enough interest by the development team members for them to volunteer to work on it's support. Please consider that a design that brings something new and novel, rather than rehashing an existing supported handset, is more likely to be accepted/gain the interest of a developer.</p> <p>Note: EdgeTX is developed by volunteers, and while innovative hardware often attracts attention, progress depends on contributors\u2019 availability. Manufacturers concerned about timelines should allocate internal resources to accelerate development. </p> </li> <li> <p>Develop and Maintain your own fork of EdgeTX</p> <p>Create your own fork of EdgeTX and implement hardware-specific modifications independently. In this case, YOUR development team assumes full responsibility for the long-term maintenance and bug fixes. Also, please do keep in mind that to adhere to the EdgeTX GPL-2.0 license, you need to ensure that your fork remains publicly available.</p> <p>Note: To avoid user confusion, always label your software as a \"custom branch of EdgeTX vx.x.x\" (never just \"EdgeTX\"). Commercial use of the EdgeTX logo is strictly prohibited. </p> </li> </ol> <p>We strongly encourage all manufacturers planning to produce EdgeTX-compatible radio transmitters to contact the EdgeTX Project Steering Committee (PSC) early for collaboration. This allows our experts to advise on optimizing your product for EdgeTX compatibility.  </p> <p>All manufacturers that are using EdgeTX are encouraged to participate in the EdgeTX partnership program.
