Ideally, this code would be moved to JS in the web page, thus opening a way to use simple CSS to customize the visual appearance. It would also allow to have a much nicer and more flexible layout using today's browser capabilities.</p> <p>In general, exporting the functions allowing for generic handling of controls (switches, pots, etc.) should allow the simulator libraries to become more generic and remove dependencies on things like ImGui and SDL altogether.</p> <p>The same applies to the simulator libraries used by Companion.

Under the open-source GPL, anyone can use EdgeTX or create a modified version of EdgeTX to use. The only stipulation is that the source code for the modified version of EdgeTX must be made available for everyone to see and use.</p> <p>There are several ways to can get a version of EdgeTX that supports your new radio hardware:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Develop the support of your hardware yourself and get it merged to EdgeTX code base</p> <ol> <li>Make the needed changes to support your hardware yourself, submit a pull request to the EdgeTX team for review. If approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch of EdgeTX, where they will be published and distributed as part of the normal release schedule.  </li> <li>The new radio will be added to our list of supported radios after the merge.  </li> <li>Future development of new features and bug fixes will include all the supported radios for consideration.  </li> <li>Manufacturers are highly encouraged to participate in testing and fixing bugs to ensure our continuous development will not break the firmware on your radios.  </li> <li>If you do not have the know-how or resources to make the needed changes to support your hardware yourself, then you can contact the EdgeTX Team to get some pointers to proceed. Alternative you can try to outsource the development to a third party who understands the EdgeTX codebase.  </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Co-develop the hardware and firmware with the EdgeTX development team</p> <p>If your radio introduces novel features (e.g., a new hardware platform and/or new hardware capabilities) and you can manage to draw the interest from one or more EdgeTX development team members, a co-development of the new radio support might become an option for you. Try to reach out the EdgeTX development members via Discord or via email at psc@edgetx.org to see if your proposed new hardware gets enough interest by the development team members for them to volunteer to work on it's support. Please consider that a design that brings something new and novel, rather than rehashing an existing supported handset, is more likely to be accepted/gain the interest of a developer.</p> <p>Note: EdgeTX is developed by volunteers, and while innovative hardware often attracts attention, progress depends on contributors\u2019 availability. Manufacturers concerned about timelines should allocate internal resources to accelerate development. </p> </li> <li> <p>Develop and Maintain your own fork of EdgeTX</p> <p>Create your own fork of EdgeTX and implement hardware-specific modifications independently. In this case, YOUR development team assumes full responsibility for the long-term maintenance and bug fixes. Also, please do keep in mind that to adhere to the EdgeTX GPL-2.0 license, you need to ensure that your fork remains publicly available.</p> <p>Note: To avoid user confusion, always label your software as a \"custom branch of EdgeTX vx.x.x\" (never just \"EdgeTX\"). Commercial use of the EdgeTX logo is strictly prohibited. </p> </li> </ol> <p>We strongly encourage all manufacturers planning to produce EdgeTX-compatible radio transmitters to contact the EdgeTX Project Steering Committee (PSC) early for collaboration. This allows our experts to advise on optimizing your product for EdgeTX compatibility.  </p> <p>All manufacturers that are using EdgeTX are encouraged to participate in the EdgeTX partnership program.  Under this program, hardware-specific features and bug fixes will be completed on a priority basis by the EdgeTX Team.

Also, if your radio has more than one USB port, ensure you are plugging it into the DATA port, not the CHARGING port. This is usually the port at the top of the radio.

Sometimes the card needs to be correctly re-formatted.</p> <p>The RadioKing TX18S and early models of the Jumper T18 have a design flaw with the SD card sensor, which results in the radio displaying this error even though an SD card was installed. The manufacturer worked around this issue by creating a custom version of OpenTX that disabled the SD card check in the software.

This year\u2019s celebration was even more special as we joined in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Heideflieger H\u00f6velhof e.V model flying club at their airfield near H\u00f6velhof, Germany.</p> <p>Attendees had the opportunity to connect with many of the EdgeTX team members and explore a diverse range of EdgeTX supported radios. The visitors were also able to see some modified radios to spawn their own creativity and we displayed stick end controls and tray setups for couple of higher end radios. Additionally, visitors got hands-on experience flying mini quadcopters, providing an exciting introduction to the RC hobby. All of this unfolded amidst a breathtaking model airshow that left everyone in awe.</p> <p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who joined us at the fest to commemorate the 2nd year of EdgeTX. Your overwhelming presence and engaging interactions made this event truly unforgettable. A big congratulations to all the lucky drawing winners! In total, thanks to our sponsors, we were able to distribute over 20 radio transmitters, close to 100 Express LRS receivers, 4 beautiful scale RC model airplanes and a large number of further accessories and merchandise to our guests.</p> <p>A special shout-out to our event sponsors, RadioMaster, Flysky, Jumper, BetaFPV, FMS, and RCVideoReviews.com, for their generous contributions of prizes and giveaways.

Users were able to test the revamped user interface with LVGL backend and check out new functions, such as model labels. Novel input concepts were also presented, such as radio orientation control via IMU and control via a 6-dimensional SpaceMouse knob. Visitors could also participate in several small competitions, such as RC Car bowling and Tiny Whoop balloon popping. Overall, the event was a great success.</p> <p>Thank you to all that came out to the EdgeTX Fest to celebrate the first year of EdgeTX with us. Your attendance made for a fun and enjoyable event!  Congratulations to all the contest and drawing winners.  In total, 11 radios and 4 accessory sets were awarded to lucky guests!</p> <p>Special thanks to our event sponsors for providing the prizes and giveaways for the event \u2013 RadioMaster, Flysky, 3Dconnexion, BetaFPV, and Jumper and to the NLV Modellflug Saarmund e.V. for their cooperation in the planning and running of the event.</p> <p>Thanks again to all participants, sponsors, and supporters of the event.

Submissions due 9 September 2022.</p> <p>May 9th, 2022</p> <p>EdgeTX v2.7.1</p> <p>This is a maintenance release for EdgeTX \"Black Pearl\" v2.7, which primarily fixes two bugs that could cause emergency mode firmware crashes, and also fixes an issue with not being able to update CRSF/ELRS module firmware. There are some other minor fixes or improvements included also. You can read about the improvements and download the firmware for your radio and the Companion for your computer from EdgeTX \"Black Pearl\" 2.7.1</p> <p>April 16th, 2022</p> <p>EdgeTX v2.7.0</p> <p>The fourth release is out - EdgeTX v2.7.0 with codename \"Black Pearl\". You can read about the improvements and download the firmware for your radio and the Companion for your computer from EdgeTX \"Black Pearl\" 2.7.0</p> <p>April 12th, 2022</p> <p>Donations via PayPal possible via Open Collective</p> <p>Single donations via PayPal finally work now as well at OpenCollective: https://opencollective.com/edgetx</p> <p>Jan. 24th, 2022</p> <p>EdgeTX v2.6.0 with YAML</p> <p>The third release is out - EdgeTX v2.6.0 with codename \"Santa\". It is the first release to include human-readable settings format YAML and a new improved themes file and folder structure. You can download the firmware for your radio and the Companion for your computer from EdgeTX \"Santa\" 2.6.0</p> <p>Nov. 11th, 2021</p> <p>Update on EdgeTX &amp; Companion support for TBS Tango 2 and Mambo</p> <p>Recently there have been many inquiries about when EdgeTX firmware will be available for the TBS Tango 2 and Mambo radios.  </p> <p>We were initially targeting to have support for those two radios in EdgeTX v2.6 (Christmas Edition). However, with the change to the FreeRTOS operating system in EdgeTX v2.5, additional unplanned efforts are required that may cause us to shift support for those two radios until EdgeTX v2.7 (Spring Edition).  </p> <p>We understand that there is great interest in EdgeTX and EdgeTX Companion support for those two radios, and you can rest assured that the teams at TBS and EdgeTX are working together to make this happen.</p> <p>Nov. 4th, 2021</p> <p>EdgeTX is now accepting donations via Open Collective</p> <p>If you would like to support EdgeTX financially, we have a donation system setup at Open Collective. All money that is donated will be used for our planned online-build system as well as to help developers purchase needed hardware (e.g. radio systems &amp; development equipment). You can send a one-time donation or set up a recurring donation via the following link: https://opencollective.com/edgetx/donate</p> <p>The usage of the money will be reported at OpenCollective and will be transparent for all to see what the money is being used for.  Your support is very much appreciated!</p> <p>Oct. 16th, 2021</p> <p>EdgeTX v2.5.0 including EdgeTX Companion</p> <p>The second release is out - EdgeTX v2.5.0 with codename \"Dauntless\".
